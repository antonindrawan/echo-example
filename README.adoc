= Echo + Swagger

This is my first try with Echo & Swagger


== Run Test
    cd backend
    go test tests/ -count=1


== Run the API backend
The commands below generate swagger documentation and run the server.

    cd backend
    swag init -g main.go && go run main.go

Go to the web browser and open: `http://localhost:8080`

== Use Docker

To build the image and start the container, run the following command:

    docker-compose up


To stop and delete the container, run the following command:

    docker-compose down



== API
